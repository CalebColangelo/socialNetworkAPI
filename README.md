# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

In this project, I created a fully functional backend database using MongoDB and Mongoose. In this application, you are able to see CRUD in action, using Insomia to interact with the app. This app is very well structured, and is easily maintainable. Allowing you to perform all essential funciton like creating, reading, updating and deleting. This app demonstrates my understanding of the backend, and use of MongoDB and RESTful APIs.


## Installation

To install, simply download from the GitHub Repo, open in your preferred code editor, and run an 'npm install'. Update your environment variables, and run 'npm start' to start the server.
After the server is started, you should be able to use Insomia to interact with the backend server.


## Credits

I used lots of ChatGPT to help me solve this challenge. ChatGPT is a great resource, as long as the code provided is properly screened and edited.
